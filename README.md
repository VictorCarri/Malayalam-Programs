#Malayalam Pluralisation Server
A project to create a server which handles requests to pluralise Malayalam nouns. Written to gain experience in writing servers.
Also includes test programs for various components of the server.

This server is split into 3 components (so far):
------------------------------------------------
1) The base server, which handles networking.
2) A library containing the server's logic. It handles parsing requests and generating errors for the server to use.
3) A library of utilities.
