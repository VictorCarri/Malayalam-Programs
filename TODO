1) Build utility library (vuh).
2) Separate request parsing and handling classes out into their own library.

Finally, the program will consist of 3 modules:
-----------------------------------------------
1) The Server program, which handles low-level networking using Boost.Asio.
2) The utilities library, which contains general utilities for Unicode, etc.
3) The Malayalam pluralisation request handling library. It contains classes which deal with pluralising Malayalam nouns.

The utilities library and the general Server program can be re-used to build other servers. Only the request-handling library need be changed.
