This directory contains headers that define preprocessor tokens that resolve to either Boost or STD entities.
The header files in this directory are used to define a single interface that the rest of the library can use to include either Boost or STD headers.
This way, the test for defines that control whether Boost or STD is used only need to be done in one place, rather than in each header.
